# WazaAPI for Java

Welcome to the Waza Application Programming Interface for Java.

We don’t have the time to write a comprehensive readme document. We will update this document with the information your need to use the WazaAPI. 

For now, we assume that you are familiar with compiling Java code and building a .jar file. 

The top package is called ‘waza’.

Import the waza package in your program. 

```import waza.*;```
